# Blog Platform with Spring Boot and Docker

This is a basic project to create a blogging platform using Spring Boot, Docker, and other relevant technologies. The platform allows users to create, edit, and publish posts, as well as interact through comments. Administrators have access to additional functionalities such as content moderation and user management.

## Project Setup:

1. **Create a new Spring Boot project** using Spring Initializr or your favorite IDE.
2. **Add necessary dependencies**, such as Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, Thymeleaf, and MySQL (or another database of your choice).

## Data Modeling:

1. **Create entities** to represent the main elements of the blog, such as `User`, `Post`, and `Comment`.
2. **Configure relationships** between these entities, such as a one-to-many relationship between `User` and `Post`, and between `Post` and `Comment`.

## Implementation of Persistence Layer:

1. **Configure database access** using Spring Data JPA.
2. **Define repository interfaces** for each entity to perform CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete).

## Development of Service Layer:

1. **Create services** to handle business logic related to users, posts, and comments.
2. **Implement methods** to create, retrieve, update, and delete users, posts, and comments.

## Security Configuration:

1. **Utilize Spring Security** to configure authentication and authorization.
2. **Define security rules** to restrict access to protected resources, such as admin pages and operations for creating/updating posts.

## User Interface Development:

1. **Create controllers** to handle HTTP requests from users, such as post creation, comment addition, etc.
2. **Implement HTML pages** (using Thymeleaf or another technology of your choice) to render the user interface.

## Implementation of Additional Features:

1. **Add functionalities** such as post search, sorting, tags, etc.
2. **Implement user profile pages** where users can view their own posts, comments, etc.

## Development of Administration System:

1. **Create administration pages** protected by authentication.
2. **Implement functionalities** such as user or post deletion, comment moderation, etc.

## Testing and Debugging:

1. **Write unit and integration tests** to ensure the correct functioning of the application.
2. **Debug and fix issues** that arise during development.

## Dockerization of the Application:

1. **Create a Dockerfile** to build the Spring Boot application image.
2. **Define the necessary steps** to package the application into a Docker container.

## Deployment and Execution:

1. **Use Docker Compose** to define and manage the necessary services.
2. **Execute Docker Compose** to build and start the containers.

This guide provides a basic framework for creating a functional blogging platform. You can customize and extend it as needed to meet your specifications and additional requirements.
